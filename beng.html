        <h3>Year 1: Laying the Foundations</h3>
        <p>
            During my first year of university, I focused on building a solid understanding of fundamental engineering concepts. The coursework covered essential mathematical principles for engineering, including mechanics and thermodynamics. 
            Alongside this, I delved into biological topics, exploring areas such as human anatomy and molecular biology, which helped establish a multidisciplinary foundation for my studies.

                    In one group assignment, we were tasked with designing a prosthetic hand using CAD. The project was both challenging and confusing, especially as it took place during lockdown when in-person meetings weren't possible, and we were still adjusting to online collaboration. 
                    Despite these challenges, the experience was incredibly rewarding. 
                    I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the various implementations of CAD, and the assignment ultimately became a fun and memorable learning experience.

        <div class="project-card">
            <h4>Student Ambassador</h4>
            <p>
                I took on the role of Student Ambassador for the AACME School (Aero, Auto, Chemical, and Materials Engineering). 
                In this role, I was responsible for highlighting the impressive offerings of the engineering faculty to prospective students, providing them with insights into academic programs, facilities, and campus life.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also served as a general Student Ambassador for the university, where I played a key role during open days and events. My responsibilities included leading campus tours, distributing informational leaflets, and assisting visitors with directions. 
                Additionally, I contributed to event setup, catering, and cleanup, ensuring a smooth and welcoming experience for prospective students and their families.

        <div class="project-card">
            <h4>Sports</h4>
            <p>
                Introductions at uni often began with, "Hey, what's your name? What sport do you do?"—which meant I had to get involved in a sport! 
                There were only two sports I had shown interest in before attending university, and I decided to give both of them a try.
            </p>
            <h5>Boxing</h5>
            <p>
                In my second year, I decided to try out boxing to learn the basic movements and engage in something worthwhile. 
                I enjoyed the experience, even though it was physically exhausting. 
                Unfortunately, I had to give it up as balancing it with my studies became challenging. 
                However, I'm open to trying a different martial art in the future.
            </p>
            <h5>Scuba Diving</h5>
            <p>
                In my third year, I gave scuba diving a try, and it was an incredible experience! I absolutely hated the cold water, but the adventure made it all worthwhile. 
                One challenge I faced was the buildup of water pressure affecting my ears, though it wasn't too severe. 
                I've almost earned my BSAC Ocean Diver license, and I look forward to going on more dives in the future!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h4>Societies</h4>
            <p>
                I joined a variety of societies, including the Hindu, Islamic, Gaming, Ghanaian, and Oriental societies, among others. Attending events hosted by such diverse groups allowed me to broaden my cultural awareness while honing my networking skills. 
                This experience helped me build meaningful connections and take my interpersonal growth to the next level.
            </p>
            <p>
                I actively contributed by helping set up events, managing clean-up, and promoting activities within the societies. I truly enjoyed the flexibility of being involved with such diverse events, meeting people from various backgrounds, and engaging in meaningful interactions.

        <p>
            My time at Loughborough was very enjoyable, everyday was something new. I value the connections I've made, and the lessons I've learnt. 
            Whilst I never felt too passionate with bioengineering, Loughborough helped me find my interest for data science. 
            For everything I have achieved, all the experiences, people, lectures, I am very grateful.
