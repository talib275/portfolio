        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
        <p>
            I began the course by building a strong foundation in mathematical principles and theoretical concepts, 
            which provided the essential background needed to comprehend and apply more advanced processes and methodologies.

                <h4>Operational Research</h4>
                <p>
                    I explored the concepts of linear programming using software like Simul8 and Vensim. 
                    This module primarily focused on mathematically optimizing various processes and systems. 
                    I found this knowledge particularly valuable, as it's essential for roles in consultancy, where optimizing business operations and strategies is often a key responsibility.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    I prepared a report assessing the efficiency of a blood testing center, where I developed a Simul8 model to analyze its performance. 
                    I then designed alternate simulations by modifying key variables, allowing me to evaluate whether the proposed changes improved overall operational efficiency.

                <p>
                    This module centered on both foundational and advanced statistical concepts using R. 
                    I explored key topics like Bayes' theorem and Simpson's paradox, developing a deeper understanding of their real-world applications. 
                    The primary focus was on conducting and interpreting tests such as t-tests and ANOVA, which significantly enhanced my ability to derive meaningful insights and conclusions from data-driven analysis.

        <h3>Computer Science</h3>
        <p>
            I developed a comprehensive understanding of core computer science principles, focusing on the foundational techniques that power data-driven problem-solving. 
            This involved mastering the logic behind algorithms, data structures, and modeling approaches, all of which set the stage for advanced applications in analysis, visualization, and decision-making processes.

                <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
                <p>
                    Throughout this learning experience, I've delved deeply into the theoretical foundations of machine learning, understanding concepts like model selection, bias-variance trade-off, and performance metrics. 
                    I've explored key topics such as data preprocessing, scaling, and encoding, which are essential to preparing datasets for accurate model predictions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've just been introduced to actually using this in Python wherein I'll be assigned projects on it very soon.

                <p>
                    Within this module, I've learned more on defining my own functions with Python. I've created functions to filter throughout text to find data quickly. 
                    This project helped me learn more about how Python can be used for text rather than just creating charts and figures.

                <p>
                    While I'm still new to this, I've learned commands such as: SELECT, WHERE, NOT, LIKE, SUM, AVG. I hope to improve a lot more in the future.

        <p>
            As I've been very busy with my course and other projects, also given that I don't live in Cardiff, I haven't been able to experience as much unfortunately.
            However, I am still enjoying myself, I've been a bit more focused on my career rather than extra-curricular activites. Having said that I still took on the responsibility of course rep.

                My responsibilities included gathering and addressing concerns from my classmates and effectively communicating them to higher authorities, including lecturers, until the issues were resolved.
